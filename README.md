YunYan Ding:
I did the code in ModelTest package. I wrote the test code. All the tests contain the process of checking the data and the exception. I build the exception handler. There are mainly three types of exceptions that we meet until now. Most of the tests followed TDD, except some of them cannot do that because of the branch merge problem.

I did the codes in the View package. I built the GUI. All the buttons have functions as "XX_Click". This is the event listeners. Also, together, Fred and I changed the codes to match each other's code. As the Result, by clicking "Ok" or "Cancle", the text of stage changes. This is our performs system and exploratory test.
